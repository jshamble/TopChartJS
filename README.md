# D3StatisticsDemo
Statistical Charting of Protein Data Bank Data using the D3 library.

## Goals

  1. Get a front end template going with the d3 library. HTML, CSS, and JS file + the D3.js
  DONE//2. subdivide the graph into an NxN (dynamically) grid using flexbox. N = 3 will be used for the purposes of this demonstration; the goal is to show different kinds of charts side-by-side
  3. Use statistics data from RCSB PDB ( rscb.org/stats ). The aim is to use a basic pie and bar chart to parse and display the data, but other more interesting options can be explored.
